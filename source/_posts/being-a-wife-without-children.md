As a stay-at-home wife, I love to gather wisdom, training, and encouragement from other women who are keepers of the home and caretakers of the family. I find myself in a unique position, as my family is a simple family of two (three including the dog). Without divulging private information about why this is the case after five years of marriage, I will simply express that I am joyful and content with the family God has given me.

While scrolling through my Pinterest feed, I came across one stay-at-home blogger who expressed that she was eager to "graduate" from stay-at-home wife to stay-at-home mom status. There is obviously quite the stigma in today's society regarding women who decide to refrain from working outside the home. I would argue there is an even greater stigma for those who make that decision without children.

Without getting into a discussion about why I have decided to stay at home (I'll save that for another post), I want to address my status as a wife without children and the stigma attached.

Women of all ages may find themselves in any number of unique situations influencing why they have or do not have children. I have often been challenged with the notion that my life will never be full, I will never actually experience love, and that I will be doomed to a sad, shallow, and superficial existence if I do not have children. These messages stroke the ego of those with children while disparaging the lives of those without.

Not having children is expressed as being "childless" or "child-free." Each word addresses either position as parent or non-parent with contrasting connotations. Both groups trying to validate the positive condition of their lives.

Whether you are a mother or not, I want to encourage you that your worth and value is not attached to the number or existence of children in your family. The state of your life is not conditioned upon your children or lack thereof. You're family is a family because God brought your husband and you together. You have always had the capacity to experience and share love, because the God who is love is with you. All the fullness of life and joy is accessible to you through Jesus Christ no matter what your marital status or the barrenness of your womb.

We don't need to validate or argue about whose lives are better. All lives are capable of experiencing joy and contentment through Jesus Christ. Let us encourage one another to be content with the lives we have been given and the choices we make.
